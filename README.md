# [SCRATCH :notes:](https://notes.appscratch.com/)

A simple note taking application using serverless technology. This is a side project on learning [serverless stack](https://serverless-stack.com/).

### Future enhancements
- Unit tests - currently there are no unit tests on sagas, reducers, components
- Billing - currently the billing is not tied directly to the main application logic which is notes. Storage size is disregarded even you already paid.
- Generic form - i saw a lot of repetitive code with form handling.
- Generic reducer - also repetitive in terms of handling same state especially on `INote` reducer.
